# Predicting Long-Term Productivity of Software Engineers

Final team project for AAI-510: Applied Artificial Intelligence  
**Team 12** â€“ Lokesh Upputri, Sabina George, Soumi Ray

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Predict developer productivity based on behavioral and environmental data using machine learning models.

## ðŸ§  Dataset
Simulated dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/ai-developer-productivity-dataset) with ~500 rows and features like:
- hours_coding
- distractions
- caffeine intake
- sleep hours
- cognitive load
- task success (target)

## ðŸ“Š Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and imputation
- Regression Models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor (final model)

## âœ… Results
Random Forest achieved:
- MSE = 0.00
- RÂ² = 1.0

## ðŸš€ Deployment Plan
Batch model via REST API on AWS or Azure; integrated into dev team analytics dashboard.
